            <h2> Our founding </h2>
            <p>REALONE was founded by Nitik Garg in 2022. It was called
              SEO REALONE,and started asablog and an online community where some of the world's
              first SEO experts shared their research and ideas.We launched the Beginner's
              Guide to SEO and our first Search Ranking Factors study,and that hub of industry
              expertise transformed intoasmall consulting firm and led us to create some of our
              first SEO tools</p>
